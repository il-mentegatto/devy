# DEVY Project

This is a basic simple C program for a physic laboratory at university. It calculate the average, relative and average deviation and maximum semi-dispersion of N values. It is generally useful for the misurament on many physic experiment.
I hope that this project will grow and become a multi-tool usefull for many physic labs and esperiment.

## Getting Started

In the repository there are two type of binary file:
- devy_for_ubuntu is the version for Linux and was compiled with a linux version of G++
- devy_for_windows.exe is the version for Windows and was compiled with MinGW
also devy_source.c is the source code with comments and references.

### Prerequisites

There isn't any kind of prerequisites

### Installing

Generally I suggest to play DEVY with the cmd or bash. Anyway there isn't any installation for start to use it. Simply clone the repo on a directory and start the program.

## Running the tests

For testing the program there is the test_script that start Devy with a simple input of 2 ad 4 like values.

### Break down into end to end tests

Actually there isn't particulary test for Devy, but in future I'll add them.
